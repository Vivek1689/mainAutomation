# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#stages

# .gitlab-ci.yml

# Define the stages of the pipeline
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

# Define a job for building the project
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - mvn clean

# Define a job for running tests
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - mvn test

# Define a job for deployment
deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deployment successful!"
